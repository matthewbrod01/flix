# Project 1 - *Flix*

**Flix** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User sees app icon in home screen and styled launch screen (+1pt)
- [x] User can scroll through a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie DB API (+5pt)
- [x] User can "Pull to refresh" the movie list (+2pt)
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies to load (+2pt)

- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to synchronize "pull to refresh" refreshControl icon and HUD loading state icon
2. How to remove refreshControl icon when pullToRefresh is called, so that only the HUD loading state icon shows instead

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
